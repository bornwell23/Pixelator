# PixelArt Creator - Project Instructions

This is a Python application for converting images into pixel art with video game aesthetics. The project supports both CLI and GUI interfaces with advanced features like custom color palettes, multiple pixelation algorithms, and batch processing.

## Project Structure
- CLI interface using argparse
- GUI interface using tkinter/PyQt
- Core image processing with PIL/Pillow and NumPy
- Multiple pixelation algorithms
- Color palette management
- Batch processing capabilities
- Live preview functionality

## Development Guidelines
- Use Python 3.8+ for compatibility
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Implement proper error handling for file operations
- Support major image formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP, GIF, TIFF)
- Optimize for performance with large images
- Provide comprehensive testing coverage

## Features to Implement
- [x] Project setup and architecture
